# Grocery-Website
This is an example website just to present what I know about web development. This website has been entirely developed by me.

I used bootstrap4 to style the UI/UX of frontend and also used AJAX and JQuery to send and recieve HTTP requests from client side to
the srver side and vice-versa.

I created backend part using Django 3.0.4.
